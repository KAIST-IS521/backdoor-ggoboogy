# Life is gambling: Coffee betting!

### Description
* This program randomly chooses a **donation angel** who will buy others coffee.
* When we execute this program, it accepts people number who is ready to lose money as a first input. Then, it accepts name of each player, and then returns the name of donation angel along with an apology message.
* This program may be really useful when we go to 'Twosome Place' (this is not a PPL).
* This program tests(uses) all instructions except **ge**.
